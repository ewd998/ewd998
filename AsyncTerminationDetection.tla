---------------------- MODULE AsyncTerminationDetection ---------------------
\* * TLA+ is an expressive language and we usually define operators on-the-fly.
 \* * That said, the TLA+ reference guide "Specifying Systems" (download from:
 \* * https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/book.html) defines a handful of
 \* * standard modules.  Additionally, a community-driven repository has been
 \* * collecting more modules (http://modules.tlapl.us). In our spec, we are
 \* * going to need operators for natural numbers.
EXTENDS Naturals

\* * A constant is a parameter of a specification. In other words, it is a
 \* * "variable" that cannot change throughout a behavior, i.e., a sequence
 \* * of states. Below, we declares N to be a constant of this spec.
 \* * We don't know what value N has or even what its type is; TLA+ is untyped and
 \* * everything is a set. In fact, even 23 and "frob" are sets and 23="frob" is 
 \* * syntactically correct.  However, we don't know what elements are in the sets 
 \* * 23 and "frob" (nor do we care). The value of 23="frob" is undefined, and TLA+
 \* * users call this a "silly expression".
CONSTANT N 

\* * We should declare what we assume about the parameters of a spec--the constants.
 \* * In this spec, we assume constant N to be a (positive) natural number, by
 \* * stating that N is in the set of Nat (defined in Naturals.tla) without 0 (zero).
 \* * Note that the TLC model-checker, which we will meet later, checks assumptions
 \* * upon startup.
